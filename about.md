“Mitra’s book provides a thoroughly modern view of the techniques for specification and verification of cyber-physical systems, expertly explaining how tools from control theory, dynamical systems, automata theory, and formal methods can be combined to analyze safety in autonomous systems. Using a combination of conceptual examples that can be used to understand basic concepts and modern applications that motivate the need for new approaches, this book provides the foundation for practitioners interested in understanding conceptual frameworks for verification of hybrid systems and researchers interested in establishing a rigorous basis for further advances.”

“This is an excellent textbook that gives a comprehensive introduction to state-of-the-art techniques in formal modeling and verification of cyber-physical systems. Its seamless integration of technical details and illustrative examples makes it ideally suited for graduate students hoping to understand this complex subject matter.”

<h5>Rajeev Alur, Zisman Family Professor in the Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Pennsylvania</h5>

"I found this to be a very thorough introduction to techniques for the specification, modeling, and formal verification of complex cyber-physical systems. The manner in which the material is presented is outstanding: rigorous, yet comprehensible thanks to the extensive use of illustrative examples. Designed as a complete textbook, but I found it to also be suitable for reading up on individual topics. Highly recommended for practitioners, students, and researchers in CPS."

<h5>Sanjoy Baruah, Hugo F. and Ina Champ Urbauer Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis</h5>
